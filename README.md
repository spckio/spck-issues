# Reporting an Issue

If you found an issue with [Spck Editor](https://spck.io) and would like to report it, please review the following guidelines and I will do my best to help you.

Please ensure that your issue does not already exist before posting. If your issue exists and is already closed, please reopen the issue instead of starting a new one.

Issue priority will be given to issues with the best information provided, please provide the following info:

- Give steps to reproduce the issues (if possible) or give details that somehow caused the issue.

- Screenshot(s) detailing the problem (if necessary).

- How does this impact you and how severely?

Feature requests are welcomed but will not be given top priority. In the future, there will be a separate place to track feature requests. Please note that not all feature requests may be accepted or implemented, but all requests will be read and deliberated.
